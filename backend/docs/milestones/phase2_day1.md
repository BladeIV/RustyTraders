# Milestone Log — Phase 2 Day 1 (2025-10-16)

## Summary
Kicked off **Phase 2 – KYC & Verification**. Restored virtualization stack (Hyper-V & WSL2), brought Docker engine online, deployed PostgreSQL 16 via Compose, and applied Prisma migration **\dd_kyc_module\**. Prisma Client generated and backend is ready to integrate KYC endpoints.

## Time & Effort
- **Date:** 2025-10-16 (Africa/Johannesburg)
- **Time Window:** 06:30 → 14:41
- **Hours Worked:** **8 h 11 m**

## Deliverables Completed
- Hyper-V hypervisor re-enabled and verified (HypervisorPresent: True)
- Docker Desktop Linux engine healthy (docker version shows Server)
- Postgres 16 container running with persistent volume
- Prisma schema updated with KYC model
- Migration applied: **\20251008123719_add_kyc_module\**
- Prisma Client v6.17.0 generated

## Validation
- docker ps shows **rustytraders-postgres-1** listening on 5432  
- Prisma migration succeeded; DB is in sync with schema  
- Manual psql login verified credentials and DB access

## Next Steps (Phase 2 – Day 2)
- Implement KYC API endpoints (/kyc/submit, /kyc/status)
- Add secure file upload (ID & selfie) with validation + rate limiting
- Admin review endpoints (approve/reject) + basic audit trail

## Notes
Infrastructure recovery (virtualization & Docker) consumed the early hours but was necessary to unblock development. Phase 2 backend foundation is complete and stable.
